# Chosen_Challenge_Attack
The Chosen Challenge Attack code has been written based on the DA_PUF_Library. ‘Chosen_Challenge_Attack’ folder contains the Matlab code for simulating the XOR APUF under the MIT license. The attacking method in this project is a CMAES attack based on the Challenge-nonFlippingProbability pairs.

The result of this code and a full description of this methodology have been presented at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01256.
